Q2- 


A2-

There are a few problems/warnings with the code:

In SingleListItem, the isSelected prop is being passed to the backgroundColor style property directly. However, backgroundColor should be a string, not a boolean. Instead, it should use a ternary operator to set the background color based on whether isSelected is true or false.


In SingleListItem, the onClickHandler prop is being called immediately instead of being passed as a function reference. It should be wrapped in an arrow function to ensure that it is only called when the item is clicked.


In WrappedListComponent, the setSelectedIndex hook is being used incorrectly. Instead of calling it as a function, it is being used as an array. It should be const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(null);.


In WrappedListComponent, the items prop is not being checked for null or undefined before mapping over it. This can result in an error if the prop is not passed or is null/undefined.


In WrappedListComponent, the propTypes definition for the items prop is incorrect. It should be PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({ text: PropTypes.string.isRequired })).
